    "# Exercise Fourteen: Project Design Starter\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll be planning out a complex project. You'll draw in some code, but focus on commenting to describe your project structure. The sample document below will guide you through organizing and annotating your project design. The primary components you'll include are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dependencies: What modules will your project need?\n",
    "- Collection: Where is your data coming from?\n",
    "- Processing: How will you format and process your data?\n",
    "- Analysis: What techniques will you use to understand your data?\n",
    "- Visualization: How will you visualize and explore your data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if you aren't exactly certain how you would implement everything - this should be a starting point for a larger research study, but it doesn't need to be a complete, functional workflow. Aim for a \"good enough\" starting point that you can reference and extend for future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note where you have something working, and where it's broken or in progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "And to help push the technical philosophy further and keep the process moving was knowing that \"An interface is a set of cognitive cues. It may look like a screen full of pictures of things inside the computer, but in fact, the interface mediates between an individual the computational activity\" (Drucker 176).\n",
    "\n",
    "\"When people change how they speak or act in order to conform to dominant norms, we call it “code-switching”\" (Benjamin 180). \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Data, in short, do not speak for themselves and don’t always change hearts and minds or policy\" (Benjamin 192). "
