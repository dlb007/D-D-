30 years, games have been held back by the idea that 'fun' is a defining factor. Sure, I love fun, and it is one of the most powerful ways to engross a player, but imagine if all films fit under the category of fun? We wouldn't have films like Schindler's List, Hurt Locker, Apocalypse Now, and the Godfather. Our medium has never had our own Citizen Kane, or it's own Godfather. Until now. If Spec Ops: The Line was the Apocalypse now of gaming, and Skyrim is the Lord of the Rings, The Walking Dead is the Dead Alive, and even that isn't doing it justice, as Dead Alive is the best zombie film ever. Look past the glitches, and we have a near perfect game. The puzzles are tricky and take a fair bit of though, the art style is the best use of cell-shading I've seen, the characters are well-written and have arcs, its atmosphere is very tense, and you have the urge to play it to the very end once you've picked it up. The episodes themselves were quite short, 3 hours at best, but the retail release actually makes it seem like one coherent game, instead of playing parts of a game months apart. Actions have consequences. The littlest choice has the hugest effect at the end of your game. Talk to another person who played this game and, most likely, his outcome would of been entirely different. All of this makes the Walking Dead compulsively playable, but not fun. It's not about the thrills of killing zombies, this game focuses on the realtionships between characters in a zombie apocalypse scenario, and makes you see how ordinary people can get along (and indeed fall out) in this scenario. Play it because you like Telltale, play it because you love zombies, play it because you love point and click adventure games, play it because you love substantial choice in games, play it because it's cheap, play it because you're sick of Halo, the bottom line remains the same: DO NOT MISS THE WALKING DEAD.","I like the game because the story and characters are just THAT good! The connection with the little girl Clementine is amazing. However, the choices you make don't change the story, the differences are very small. The ending wil always be essentially the same. It is short and sweet and replaying it is not a good idea, the second run detaches you from the characters and story and also it's then you start noticing how insignificant your choices are. And yet I recommend this to everyone, just because the story and characters are that damn good.","The Walking Dead gathers everything from entertainment &amp; emotion. It had its ups and downs and maybe the time limit bothered me every now and then, but the role-playing elements keeps your attention towards the screen. One of the most unique games I've ever played. Thank you Telltale Games.","Captures the essence of The Walking Dead Comic Book perfectly!\r This game is truly a masterpiece. The Walking Dead has fantastic gameplay that relies on the player choices moreso than anything else and the game benefits from this as there are many heart-pounding sections that require quick thinking or else the Zombies kill one of your extremeley likeable comrades!\r These characters are even better written than they are in the TV Show and engage the player into their unique back stories that are inextricably linked to the present events. Everything feels right; not a single objective in the game seems pointless. Character development here is one of the best in this medium as each character goes through their own grim, adult and realistic arcs that are very intriguing - It sucks you in right from the get-go.\r The graphics are perfect! Brings the comic books to life better than anything else (I really wish the TV Series followed up on this style as it actually resembles the source material.)\r Overall, a true modern masterpiece and a perfect representation of The Walking Dead by Telltale Games. The Zombie genre has never been better!","By far, the best game I have ever, and will ever, play. No other game has gotten me more connected to these characters, no other game has made me feel and emote like this, **** it, in any other entertainment medium. There is just so much genius behind the game that I won't go through as that'll take a long ****ing time to talk about, just know this: This is the best game ever created and if you haven't played it, you better do that now.","What is there to say about this game, that hasn't already been said? The story telling is top notch, one of the best tales all of gaming has to offer. Never before have I been so involved and cared so much about the characters in a story in this medium, or any other before it. The gameplay is equally compelling. Point and click fans will no doubt love it, and even my friends who are normally all about action and multiplayer can't help but love it. There is more then enough action, even if it is normally displayed as a QTE or quick time event, to keep you on your toes. You'll never know when something may pop out and attack, and you'll need to fight your way out of an awful situation. Honestly, if you haven't played this game yet, do it. It's as necessary a foot note in the story telling of video games as the great classics of film.","I've always been a pretty big gamer but this was one of the first games (alongside Heavy Rain) to turn story telling into an actually like-able and fun game! Don't bother trying to hold back tears, we're all grownups here. No judging.","Positive:\rNovelty\rThe Game plays like a Movie\rI like the characters.\r Negative:\rLinear story line\rSomehow, I do not feel like playing The Walking Dead 2. Maybe I am sick of it.","I just love Walking dead - the comic book, the TV-series and the game. However considering TellTales Walking Dead a game might be to go a step to far, but not in a bad way. I consider TellTales Walking Dead series more like a \u201clive\u201d storybook where I as a \u201cplayer\u201d get to choose the outcome. And it\u2019s a great story, well worth to \u201cplay through\u201d \u2013 A real emotional roller coaster!","One of the best stories in a game, makes you feel for the characters and regret your hard decisions even though you know in your heart it was the right choice.\r Speaking of the right choice, the right choice is to buy this now!","Video games are art, or are they? This is a question that has been floating around the industry for years but has never truly been taken serious until this generation of gaming. In many ways it really comes down to how grounded your opinion of art is. Is art free form to you? Is it something that can only be achieved via deep principals, or is it simply anything and everything that is created as a form of expression? While I am not going to further this argument with this review, I will say this. If video games have the ability to be art simply through story telling and tapping at the spine of our emotions then Telltale","This game features a great narrative with some tense moments and great voice acting. It's a great revival for the Point-n-Click Adventure genre, and its transition to the PS3 was smoother than expected. The game does feel kind of slow and unfair at times, but the impactful and emotional moments that all five episodes have to deliver are more than enough to make up for that.","Storytelling in gaming at it's finest. Every episode is engaging right from the start of Episode 1 to the climatic ending of Episode 5. You mold the story based on your choices. There isn't much to talk about the game, all I can say is go and buy it because I know for a fact that you will not be disappointed.","Tell Tale have crafted a masterpiece with their rendition of TWD, the game is full of difficult choices and ways to express the characters vulnerability. The relationship between 37 year old convicted killer  Lee Everett and 8 year old Clementine is the selling point of this game. The walking dead is good at drawing emotion from the player through any means necessary, whether its by killing characters off unexpectedly, making us choose who dies or by unthinkable events, (such as having to kill a child)\rThe ending leaves many a person crying and distraught, showing the games ability to draw emotions from the audience. My GOTY 2012. All in all, Tell Tale have struck video game gold.","When I first heard that this game had won Game of the Year I though that was supposed to be a joke; I mean, in a year with Borderlands 2, Assassins Creed 3, XCOM, Resident Evil 6, Journey and so many fantastic games I must say I was very skeptical about The Walking Dead the Game. But then... I PLAYED it. And I must agree. The Walking Dead IS THE GAMING EXPERIENCE of 2012. Never before have I ever experienced such an intense game. I didn't play it - it PLAYED me. My fears, my adrenaline, my remorse, guilt, doubt. It got me constantly thinking about my steps and decisions and really worrying about the people around me. It reminded me of Heavy Rain, some how, but it went further; it took more risks. The Walking Dead The Game is not afraid of chocking or disturbing. Believe me: IT'S ALL THERE. This game must not be missed.","This game is a must have. It","In all of the years that I played video games, I've never come across a game like Telltale's \"The Walking Dead\".\rI've never felt the emotion of when a friendly character dies in any other video game I have ever played.\rAnd while it is true that there is not much gameplay, the story makes up for it as you change the future of yourself and every character around you with every choice you make, or sometimes even saying a particular sentence.\rThe guy you play as is a very likeable and charismatic character, as are the rest of the people you'll meet along the way. And while some characters aren't nice to you, you'll never know what happens to them or yourself next.\rPlay it, and love it.","This game is one of the most immersive I have ever had the privilege to play. Although it doesn't feature revolutionary technology and graphics, the most appealing factor is the story and the characters. Presented to us in the form of a TV show with consistent episode releases, The Walking Dead is so cleverly written and performed by voice actors that you become so attached to the characters. You begin to care so much that you are very often given a choice that will affect who lives and who dies, which is the closest to being in control that a gamer could ever be. I fell in love with the characters and story, with so many twists and turns, and I didn't want the experience to end. The level of choice and interaction with the game is splendid, giving a new perspective to point-and-click games. This game is a benchmark in gaming and deserves to become an inspiration to others in the industry.","I read a review from a member saying the storyline is linear, I laughed and i must say it is anything but! you make choices which can impact the next 3 episodes of the game, even small things like if you swear infront of a kid, 2 episodes later the kid will swear because you swore! and if you choose not to, it doesnt.\rIt is so emotional and gripping, but i can assure you as an 18 year old guy I did definitly not cry............ okay, i did","Just a heads up I have played all 5 episodes of The Walking Dead, but I downloaded them off of Playstation Network, so this isn't a review of this disc set, it's a review of what I think of all 5 episodes as a whole and the score you see is an average of the score I gave to each individual episode. To learn more about each episode individually please read my reviews of them. Telltale Games has created a masterpiece, it's emotional, intense, dark, and an excellent addition to the Walking Dead universe. In this game your tasked with two things, protecting a little girl and making decisions that will effect every step of your journey until the credits roll and your adventure ends. The story is excellently written and ties in perfectly with the comic book universe. It's filled with moments that will stick with you long after you've played it and characters you care about. The only complaint I really have with the game are it's technical issues. The Walking Dead: A Telltale Games Series is one the best games of the year and if you haven't played it yet you really need to. It's nothing less than a true masterpiece.","Definitely an unique experience in the gaming realm. Often times great story telling is hindered in games by gameplay, especially of the RPG grind variety. That is of course assuming a great story is even in a game or if it is simply getting by on gameplay.\r The Walking Dead moves fast and the story never lets up. While one would assume it would be more like a traditional puzzle adventure game it does not play that way. The narrative is not slowed down. Like another great game this year, 'Journey' the story and feelings invoked stay with you long after the game is finished.\r I find it odd that Heavy Rain is often compared to this. I gave HR two hours, but it never really got past monotony. There could have been a good story, but no one I knew ever got to it. The Walking Dead does not require investment time before it gets good, it simply is good from start to finish.\r Few games I would describe as a must play for a gamer. This one is a must play.","Season one of The Walking Dead games is a true cinematic experience with great comic book style graphics, a very touching story, and the mechanic of having every small decision affect the story. Just keep in mind that one of the chapters is kind of boring and there are some de-syncing glitches here and there.","An amazing game with good storytelling and emotional impact. This game is a must-have, it has depth and tension. You owe it to yourself to play this game. It is absolutely a masterpiece.","This is definitely one of the greatest games I've ever played. It's very possibly that you might crawl up into a fetal position and sob if you play this game, but still a great game. I gave it a nine though because the amount of language is overkill, otherwise awesome game.","Great art style, and great narrative equals a fun experience for a good price but without replay value because your choices really do not affect the storyline. Well worth the 4 dollars I spent renting it.","I don't understand the fascination with this \"game.\" Sure, it had a couple of high points, but for the most part I found it is an extremely slow and boring experience. I don't qualify \"decision-making\" as gameplay.","this game may not be another call of duty shoot em up but it does have so much emotion and mind boggling choices that make you look at your inner self. i cannot wait for season two. this also comes in number 2 for games of 2012 for me","This is not a game; it is an interactive movie, and I use the term loosely.  It it not nearly as interactive as other non-games like Indigo Prophecy or Heavy Rain.  The choices presented almost never matter.  You either choose one of four things to say, which are basically the same thing restated, or you go through the few choices given until you are left with the one that advances the story.  Then you walk around and find people to talk to or look at.  I thought this would be much more of an adventure games with more inventory items or puzzles.  I knew it would have a \"choose your own adventure\" quality to it, but I didn't realize the choices were almost non-existent.  It is the equivalent of watching a poorly-animated direct-to-DVD movie, except your DVD player pauses every few minutes and then you have to pick up the remote and press a button to get it to continue.\rI really don't get it.  Practically no puzzles.  Pretty much no action.  Just dialogue and wandering around.\rGame of the Year?  How did that happen?\rThe art style is adequate for this type of thing, and most of the voice acting (with the exception of the horribly grating little girl) is decent.  OK story, but just read the comics.  They are better and nearly as interactive.\rWhat a disappointment.  I'm glad I just rented it.","Rent, don't buy. My biggest gripe with this game is the ending. Mild Spoiler - none of your choices matter AT ALL. All the fun I had playing the game (of which there was plenty) was completely stripped away by the ending, which is the same no matter what you do, what you say or who you try to save. There is no pay-off. A game like Heavy Rain is much better in this regard since there are multiple endings, and your earlier actions drastically affect how the game turns out, who you save and who is alive/dead. One option allows you to save everyone, and another lets them all die, and so much in between. Characters can die but they don't have to if you save them. But in the Walking Dead everyone who dies will die. I was very keen to replay this game right until the final moment. Now, why would I bother? It makes no difference. Meh...","This was the worst game I have played in a long time.  Worst game of the year!  The graphics are bland, the gameplay is non-existing, the story is slow, and the time I invested was wasted.  The only reason I am not giving this game a complete 0/10 is I feel bad for the designers.","The game is good with selectable choices but it's SAD,very SAD; with CAPS and that's not cool.\rA zombie videogame of point and click gameplay, adaptative history telling and dramatic cutscenes i got to admit  just very entertaining.Long time no see games with that structure the graphics are ok without being outstanding but enough to keep you interested is more of a comic book style.\rBut like I already mention the whole game,with all chapters complete is SAAAAD very!.The history  is designed to whatever choice you make,but no matter what's your choices are, is going to end in tragedy and that's simply dissapointing.Never wrote a review based on history but nowadays seems to be a factor.The game is so sad that remembered me that 80's B-movies tragedy-drama type that you would like to simply forget. Looks like history is going to be decisive in videogames nowadays another examples of unlikely history are,Max Payne 3 and Mass Effect 3.Jeez a good game is just ruined by the complete history.Lame.","This is the most overrated game I've ever played. Bought it and expected a game nearly perfectly done. This game is sadly not. Never mind that the game glitches _all the time_, so bad that I often miss action sequences and dies, that would nearly be forgivable if the gameplay, story, artwork and graphics was good. The episodes are VERY short. The story is linear. The artwork and graphics are bad. Just get The Last of Us instead, that game is just perfectly done. This you should skip until you've exhausted every other option.","It baffles me why people consider this game to be the best of the year. There's nothing in this game that hasn't been done before and its linearity and weak gameplay are really off-putting.","TWD is a awesome game! Telltale make me care with characters, the choice system is fantastic by delivery a sense of urgency with its time count bar, that by all means make you have to do hard choices in a little time, this make the tension grows as it would in a real life emergency context. The plot is rich and the characters too, both becoming meaningful by the length of the game to the point that your choices consequences really make you regret some of your actions in a way that other games can't make you feel, I bet that the reviewers that gave notes like ZERO would prefer to play Call of Duty or other brainless game.","When i first heard of this game, it perked my ears but i was hesitant because of Telltale Games. They have been a bit sloppy in their past few games, Back to the Future was good but Jurassic Park was terrible. Once i played The Walking Dead though, all my fears were not just dropped, they were crushed. The game plays out like its own TV series, with 5 episodes that chronicle the events that occur around Lee, a convicted criminal that is thrust into the zombie apocalypse with a little girl named Clementine. From there, you meet many different characters and different settings, each with their own challenges and events that mold your own experience with The Walking Dead. The story is the forefront of this game, characters you meet and interact with make you grow. You decision at what to tell each person effects everything from there on. Talking is its own gameplay challenge. You have 2-4 different choices when you talk to others with a very limited time to answer, some much faster than others according to the situation. This creates a built tension that carries throughout each episode, and it all comes together at the end in the most satisfying way I can image. That said, this is NOT a perfect experience the whole way. The game is quite glitchy, and starting a new episode usually has a slow start as the game tries to get all the information from the last episode. Since this is the zombie apocalypse, you will have encounters against the undead. Fighting them off needs quick button pressing, which actually works just fine with the rest of the game, but its not perfect. Overall, The Walking Dead is easily Telltales best game by far. Its cheap, each episode only lasts long enough to keep your attention long enough till its over and you want to get to the next episode, but for the best experience you should wait a few days till the next episode, makes it feel like the real show.","Telltale's The Walking Dead is a poor 'game' but an excellent experience. The plot, dialogue and characterizations are currently unparalleled within gaming. These characters live and breath just as much as the ones on the HBO TV series. The choices that you make in the game feel really profound and you find yourself fretting over almost every one. There is literally nothing negative to say about The Walking Dead as a story telling tool. It's awesome. Likewise, the graphics and sound do their job perfectly.  Particularly impressive are the facial animations, which along with the phenomenal voice acting, really help to immerse the player in the game's world. The only time The Walking Dead hits rocky territory is when it turns back into a 'game'. The controls during the action scenes are quite clumsy and can lead to frustration, especially when you have to repeatedly replay sections. That totally yanks me out of the world and spoils parts of the game for me. Nether-the-less, The Walking Dead is a harrowing, intense and unforgettable ride. Do not miss it.","The walking dead:A Telltale Games series has to be by far one of the best games I have ever played in my lifetime. This is not your typical zombie first person shooter, nor is it a game set on stunning graphics to impress the gamer. But what set's this game apart from any other game is the brilliant story where every decision you make has a different outcome and has it's own consciousnesses. Telltale games did a brilliant job who carers about the graphics not being top notch because at the end of the day it is the story that will really keep you hooked till the very very end.","Story: 9.5 out of 10 Graphics: 8 out of 10 Gameplay: 8 out of 10 Fun: 8.5 out of 10 Controls: 8.5 out of 10 Ease to Learn: 8 out of 10\rLength: 8 out of 10\rRe-play: 7 out of 10\rAudio: 8 out of 10\rBugs/Glitches: some","Anyone who doesn't view Telltale's The Walking Dead as a masterpiece doesn't have a good taste in games.  After a frustrating experience with AMC's The Walking Dead television adaptation, I was surprised to see that Telltale was able to capture the gruesome dark horror of Kirkman's comic, with some amazing new characters and stories.  A must play.","Sometimes, the game doesn't run that smoothly, and the \"point-and-click\" gameplay is nothing to write home about. However, the game looks pretty good and the story (oh, the story...) is absolutely one of the best you'll find in video games. I highly recommend this game.","I love the graphics and the story so far.  But a game like this relies on immersion.  Nothing defeats that as thoroughly as forcing people to use certain keybindings.  WASD for movement?  Really?  Thanks for making that decision for me and ruining my game play experience.   So I am slamming this game on a technical level because there is just no excuse for releasing a game on the PC without allowing customization of key bindings.  Amateurs!","When i first buy this game early this year, was hopeful to have both good gameplay&amp;story true out i was right, Best Comic video game ever released\rStory: 8/10\rGameplay: 7/10\rTotal: 8/10","This game is just another complete rip-off of angry birds. The game itself is exactly the same except the graphics quality is much lower and the gameplay is significantly less user friendly.","As a Walking Dead fan, this game is a must-have! Great story, great action, and environment! The only problem with this game is the lag at the beginning of most scenes.","Game of the Year for 2012 indeed. Addicting gameplay with some realistic violence. It both shocked and compelled me. The voice acting, choices and everything else is great.","It's a hard one to call. As stand alone episodes this game was a set of mini masterpieces. There are great set pieces, tense moments and hard decisions to be made here, and it is realistic and thought provoking in what it provides. Though as a stand alone title it's just not quite up to scratch, since the gameplay mechanisms get a little tiring about halfway. The most part of the game is spent hunting for objects via a point and click system, or conversing with your companions, who will always be upset with you for one reason or another. This wouldn't be a problem if your actions meant something, but on the most part they have very little impact on the ultimate outcome.\rOn the positive side, the story does something rarely seen in video games  pulling you into its narrative, asking questions about the point of humanity, and developing themes of hope and despair. I left feeling empty and hollow (not a bad thing) after the closing chapter, but I wish there was was something I would want to go back to this game for  sadly there isn't. Enjoy the 8-10 hours it lasts, it will be your last...","This game will tear out your heart, eat your soul and devour your feelings. And I didn't mind AT ALL because this game is probably one of the best games out there. There is almost nothing to like about this game because you can feel how passionate the storytellers and game makers are when you play it. You become invested in the characters and the story and you will cling on for dear life right up to the fantastic and shocking finale!","Ethical drama that excels both as game and as story. Not scary at all. Puzzles are very basic with the exception of two or three problems. The good thing is you don't get stuck, and can keep it flowing as a story. The themes in the game are of psychological, social, ethical character, and if you've studied these themes they can seem a bit basic and textbook-like in the game. But it's all tailored to the story to make it feel practical and contextual. And that works so well! Characters are very memorable and distinctive and fill out different roles very well. I usually mix up names of members of big casts, but these characters each were so well presented that I recognized every name, and still remember most of them a few days later. I was scared to lose them not just because I cared about them but because they were useful in the gameplay and all destinies seemed interwoven. There's not a 'bad' episode, they are all equally worth playing, but personally I thought episode 2 and 5 had the most thematic weight to them.","This game is basically Heavy Rain 2 you can say. The game is definitely more interactive, and if I could rate this game based on the story and characters/decision making I would give it a 10. Don't get me wrong, I love this game, but I found out most of the decisions you'll make doesn't affect the story at all; the story is probably the best you'll see in a video game has to offer. Must-buy especially if you enjoyed heavy rain.","Telltale's The Walking Dead (TWD) is an emotional experience like no other and a breath of fresh air in the industry. It's an adult experience that will leave you with tears in your eyes in some parts.\rSTORY AND CHARACTERS: This is where the game shines. It starts with a slow pace which is kept throughout the game. This slow pace gives you the opportunity to develop your thoughts and feelings about the characters which is exactly what Telltale wants so that you feel the sense of loss when you're forced to make (tough) decisions. Genius!\rPRESENTATION: Phenomenal! The sets are beautiful with the cell shading. Music is never played too loud so that you can stay immersed on the post-apocalyptic world that you're in.\rGAMEPLAY: My major issue with the game. Although it served me throughout the game and never ruined my experience the controls are a bit clumsy and fail many times especially in the action sequences. Not that there are many but it's kind of annoying to try and make an action and it doesn't respond.\rTWD is an emotional ride that will blow you away. And if you're a fan of the TV show like me it will let you prolong the experience in a different story arc.","Not fan of \"game's\" like this, story is fine but there is almost no actual gameplay and graphics is SO outdated. Also there so many choice options but results are almost same.","I'm a big fan of open-world, make-your-own story kind of games, but there is something to be said for linear gameplay that is still varied enough through your impactful choices to make differences later on in the game. Particularly when those decisions are as weighty and important as the ones that this game constantly presents. The characters and personalities are varied and wonderful, with excellent voice acting that adds to the depth and reality of each. Excellent plot and storytelling, in my opinion. While I wish there were more things you could do other than walk around, point and click, and occasionally make the aforementioned heavy decisions, this game still proves to be highly entertaining and intriguing.\r Looking forward to playing Season 2 once all the episodes are completed.","Not much of a game, more of an interactive movie, but it's quite fun. There's lots of suspense and plot twists which will keep you hooked until the end. Unfortunately, the game leads you to believe that your choices have a real affect on what happens to the characters, but your decisions turn out to be almost  totally inconsequential from chapter to chapter. Because of this, there is virtually no replay value whatsoever. If you buy this game you will probably be very disappointed, but if you rent it you will be glad you did.","It's riveting stuff. Emotionally powerful and breathlessly suspenseful, it does what all the best games out there do: it leaves you wanting more. In a great, great way.","At first, I have never heard \"The Walking Dead\" until the end. When I go to IGN every day, I saw the review of Episode 5 and give this game a 9.5 out of 10. I was like this episode seem special. I began to play \"The Walking Dead\" for the first time and bought a Season Pass of Full Episodes.\r Started Episode 1. Finished it... For me, it's interesting and wanna play more. There I met those characters, Lee and Clem. Both of them are great and wanna to learn more about them. Especially Clem.\r From beginning to the end... (Man... The ending), it's damn sad. First time of my gaming life, I cried. I though episode had nothing special, but prove wrong. It is special. For me, I never cried in gaming until this game, gives me sadness. I said nothing. All quiet. and just turn off the game, and just walked out of the house and think about the music and lots of thoughts about Lee and Clem.\r The point is as the bottom line... Buy it. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!!","Awesome Story, not so great gameplay. Better than watching the AMC series, the game has nice character development and alternative choices that impact on the game.","Exceptional. For a game to redefine the way I feel about games after I've seen so much is amazing. To do it through what is essentially such a simple interface system is astonishing. Never before have I felt so engrossed in a storyline in a game, so bothered about the characters. We may have had a poor year in general for games but with this and Farcry 3 we have been spoilt with two true masterpieces. An absolute essential purchase.","When it comes to this game, there are two kinds of people. The ones who are absolutely endeared by the storytelling and the others who are disgruntled by the repetitive gameplay. I am very positive about this game but I do note the lack of diversity. To start off, the storytelling is amazing. The characters are very real and you either want to care for them or really hate them. The relationship between Lee and Clemetine is the big thing but other characters are well brought out too. The separate episodes idea was a genius move for telltale. They would leave gamers constantly in anxious for the next installment. This is a highly emotional game, and don't be ashamed for shedding a few tears. Next, the gameplay is your basic click and interact type. However, you also have to interact with the characters. Make them trust you when your reputation really sucks. Although a bit repetitive, your choices really do matter.","Rate this a 5, I dont see how people can rate this game a 10, yall must be die hard fans lol, I love the Tv series of the walking dead but this game was boring, not much gameplay and your mostly watching some bad animation, Game Lagged alot. The story is great but they should have just made this a animated tv show series not an interactive game.","One of the best games I have ever played, I've never even read the Walking Dead comics or seen the show, but this game really makes me want to.  I wish there could be more games like this that focus on story and characterisation, as opposed to the bland shooters that seem to be coming out every year.","Now this is what a Walking Dead game should be! This game has everything that Survival Instinct sorely lacked! You care about the survivors that you're with and their stories, you want them all to live but you know that in a world overcome by a zombie apocalypse that it just can't happen. It's emotional, its suspenseful and its action packed! It is The Walking Dead and if you're a fan of the show or comics you owe it to yourself to go pick this one up if you haven't already!","I liked this game quite a bit, however the replay value is close to none. It's supposed to \"change the story depending on your choices\" but, frankly, its seems far to linear to even make that claim. The quite should be \"make choices to marginally change the story\"\r Despite the almost outright lay about that, its a good linear game, cool story, worth the money, but be clear, its a linear game, period.","I'm not a fan of the Walking Dead TV series but picked this up due to the good reviews plus it was only $20NZD. Great value at that price as this was an enjoyable experience. And I mean experience as this is more an interactive movie. The story is interesting and the characters are reasonably well done for the most part.\r The reason I didn't give this a higher score was your decision making in the game didn't seem to have a massive effect on the storyline. It just seemed to change who survived and who didn't. Where if you compare it to a similar game like Heavy Rain, some decisions in that totally change the direction the game heads in.\r Still, this was enjoyable and well worth playing as it is very cheap and is an easy platinum for the trophy whores out there.","It's not perfect as a game by any means BUT your bond with clementine and just awesome characters each pretty interesting this game is more then worth your money.I'm not saying much about this because you just need to play it to know.I more then understand why this game won game of year.","Let me make one thing clear  I am not a fan of the zombie genre in general. But I took a chance on this one, and good lord, this game is incredible. I don't think I've found a game yet that matches this level of character development. I felt closer to these characters in just a few hours than I've felt to ones I've played/watched several dozens of hours with. It made my laugh out loud and, yeah, it made me cry.\r Get it. You won't be disappointed if you have an ounce of empathy."," Clementine. I could end any article on that name and all who have played the game would nod in agreement. I can start off by telling you that I have never cried while playing a video game before and I was tearing up, fighting the tears back during the last few moments of the season. I\u2019m even feeling a bit choked up now, this proof of a tale being told correctly.\rYou can forget about its solid gameplay, intelligent artistic direction that appeals to both the comic book and television show lovers, and even the phenomenal voice acting that drives the belief home. This game centers around characters; your relationships.\rOriginally, I was enticed simply by this awesomely immersive universe of a zombie-ridden planet, but in the end I was wholly invested in being this little girl\u2019s guardian and I\u2019d be damned if anything happened to Clementine. It\u2019s raw emotion. TellTale grabs you and drags you through the muck of anxiety, depression and helplessness, and you\u2019ll love it. This episodic ends with your head in your hands and only leaves you wanting more.\rHonestly, if you haven\u2019t played this game, I don\u2019t care if zombies aren\u2019t your thing or whatever horrible excuse you have for not playing this yet is, go pick up this game. And Journey, but this first.","The walking dead will forever be one of my favorite games of all time. It goes away from shooter games and goes for the old fashioned style of games. It is a linear point and click game that is very entertaining for many reasons. First the game has a superb graphic style, following after the comic books. Second, there are a lot of memorable characters and likable at that, many games fail to make characters likable but this game succeeds in making them relatable and liked by us all. Last the game has a choice consequence sort of style, that the choices you make effects what happened later. Overall this is a great game with a good story, characters, and style...sadly the game is quite short and there a  few glitches..it can easily be excused.","What games should be like. The walking dead series by Telltale games is best serie and one of the best games i have ever played. This game makes you sad, happy even angry on some points. Dialogues are very good and voice acting is also great.\rThe decisions you have to make were hard to make and they came so fast in front of you. Afterwards i had sometimes feeling i chose wrong and it made me feel bad. Lets not forget the happiness of saving others and helping them and the reunions. Relationship of the main character lee and a little girl clementine is sad, cute and interesting. Lets not forget the gruesome part of the farm. It made me sometimes thinking \"jesus this is heavy S***\" Though it happened some sad parts too and those made me almost cry (like the ending)\rThis game is not for everyone though. This is for mature only because of the variety of feelings and contents.\rShortly said this is best game ever. Best feeling ever when game makes you feel like this. Everyone mature enough should buy this game.","This is a pretty good game.The Walking Dead video game is like better than the Walking Dead TV series.The storyline in this game is pretty much why I'm giving this game a high score.It has a dramatic storyline and it is also a memorable game.The main character in this game is Lee Everett he is a guy that was supposedly gonna put down to jail but the moment the car crashes down to a forest he was knocked out for maybe a couple of weeks and he wakes up the police died and after he took the keys in the dead police guy's pocket  and freed himself the police woke up as a zombie tried to attack Lee but Lee shot the police in the face with a shotgun.So the shot was really loud so the zombies came chasing Lee and then Lee was able to escape that despite his broken leg and then she meets a little girl in a house named Clementine without her family so Lee decided that she would take care of Clementine until her family finds her.There the story will begin.\r So anyways this game is incredibly good a work of an art a well developed game and it is one of the best games out there.This game deserves a 9/10 from me which is good.You any of you guys who want to buy a good game try buying this incredible game.I'm telling you this game is good.","It is amazing how such simple gameplay can make such a tense experience the story is told excellently and the comic book style is surprisingly well done.","After buying the season pass for this game, I didn't know what to expect, especially after playing telltale's awful back to the future series. However after only 5 minutes of playing the first episode, I knew that this game would be well worth the money. With relatable characters and an amazing storyline that had me almost in tears, especially at the end, I found myself in Lee's shoes feeling the weight upon his shoulders. I  felt a personal responsibility for Clementine and I felt as if it were me who had survived the zombie apocalypse, 10/10, excellent game. Telltale really pulled out all the stops.","I took shot In the dark with this game. The only reason I ever gave it a chance at first was because it was Walking Dead. Telltale had done similar style games before they tackled The Walking Dead with projects like Back To The Future and Jurassic Park. From what I heard Jurassic Park was a steaming pile of trash which made me extremely worried for how the game would turn out. But somehow Telltale managed to do something amazing by making one of my favorite games of all time. This 5 episode series was something that I have never seen done before. With a market saturated with FPS it's hard to come by something so original. I think part of the fun was having to wait a month for the next episode to come out. The anticipation made me count down the days until each one came out. Now a days you can buy the whole game on disk which is fine, but I feel you will not get the same enjoyment out of it as I and the others that played it on release. But don't let this keep you from playing the game. From a graphical stand point it is nothing amazing, but its not trying to be. It has a comic book style look which surprisingly works extremely well. What people buy the game for is not its graphics but for its fantastic story and character development. From beginning to end you care for characters and strive to make the best choices for you and the group. Their all some small glitches that may freeze the game for a second, but they are rare and do not hurt the game. Each episode is different from the last and leaves you begging for more when it comes to a end. To top it all of it is on sale on for Playstation Plus members for $10. This is a game that deserves all the praise that it has gotten and was my 2012 GOTY.\r 9.5/10","When I first received this game in the mail, I expected to play a game where I was relentlessly shooting zombies, using both skill and big guns to succeed and ensure my survival. To my surprise and eternal delight, I was completely wrong. Instead of a shooter, I got one of the most nerve-wracking, intense, and heart wrenching experiences I have ever played in a video game. Telltale Games' The Walking Dead is definitely the most unexpected and best experience I have played all year.\r First off is the concept. You play as a character named Lee who comes into contact with a little girl, Clementine, who has been separated from her family due to a zombie outbreak. As the first one to find her, Lee takes on the responsibility to protect Clementine and reunite her with her family. This creates a very heart-felt story centering around the relationship and fate of two people. You meet other survivors along the way, and develop relationships with them, whether they be positive or negative, and this ultimately shapes the story in ways you don't expect.\r The gameplay isn't a shoot-em up but is instead something else entirely. The main form of gameplay is using a cross-hair that scrolls across the screen using the right analog stick, which in turn allows you to interact with the world using the action buttons and on screen prompts. Since the cross-hair is controlled by the right analog stick, naturally, you don't have control of the camera. Luckily, the game did a fine job in capturing the right angles for your play through and rarely did I get annoyed with the lack of control. The cross-hair itself is a little slow in movement, but it helps to keep up the intensity in suspenseful situations. The game also uses conversation choices using the action buttons to change the story as well as your relationship with other characters in the game. Your choices in conversation also come with a time limit which is used only in situations that are supposed to keep you on edge. In other words, this time limit is used exceptionally well and at the right times, but you will end up choosing conversation pieces you didn't want to. You'll soon learn that your choices in both conversation and action can greatly affect what happens in the story. Characters will remember the tiniest things you said or did which affects how the story unravels. However, you won't see the full effect of your choices until the very end of chapter 4 and throughout chapter 5. Until then, your choices won't seem to mean anything. Lastly, there are some shooting sequences which work very well, although, they aren't commonly used.\r The soundtrack unfortunately isn't very special. Throughout the game, no soundtracks made much of an impression, save for the country song used in the end credits. The voice acting is decent enough, but like the music doesn't make an impression. Also, there were some frame by frame problems. There were a couple of times where the game would lag and would freeze for a second or two and then continue. This happened more than a few times. Luckily, these problems went away after several minutes.\r I'm not sure how to feel about the graphics. They resemble Borderlands graphics by using cartoon outlines. However, the cartoon outlines are the only thing that give any detail. So, if there isn't much drawn out detail in objects (like buildings), the graphics can look undetailed and plain. Expect this a lot in backgrounds.\r Lastly, is the best part of the game; the story. The story is by far one of the best I've ever seen and even rivals the well-written story of the Metal Gear saga. Every character you meet for an extended amount of time has a well-developed personality, whether they be bad or good. Not a single character appears bland and boring or under developed. Also, every chapter is very well written, and will either create intense or heart breaking moments. Relationships with characters really vary, and it's surprising how yesterday's friend will easily come to resent you in a few hours. This story is also one of the saddest I've ever played before. I have never once cried while playing a video game, but this is the very first game that I ever came close.\r This game has its faults, but these aren't even remotely big enough to dissuade you from playing. This game has one of the most compelling stories and a unique gameplay mechanic to keep you interested from beginning to end. I don't care about what genre you're into. The Walking Dead is a game that cannot be missed by anyone.","Wow. Just...wow.\rA video game has never made me cry before. \"It's just a game\", I thought. How have I become so emotional? How have all these characters grown on me and made such an impression? Why do I feel responsible for the safety of a little girl that isn't even real? How am I going to admit to my friends that I just sobbed like a girl?\rTelltale games have made the biggest emotional roller-coaster of video game history.  It's a classic puzzle/adventure game featuring panic inducing moral choices and fantastic voice-over work with a refreshingly intelligent adult storyline.\rI will say no more other than I would recommend this game to absolutely everyone as a must play.","I don't normally give out 10s but this game deserves an 11.  This game is the most engaging and fun game I have played.  You get so connected and so invested in everything that is going on.  It may not be action, but more like watching an awesome movie where you make the decisions.  I even love how it has slower moments to allow you to talk to the characters.  Everyone should try this game.","This game is a masterpiece!! I really love how your decisions effect the game so much and the story is not bad either. Really fun game!!!  And every character is so different too.","This game was my Game of the Year for 2012, and their is a reason why. The voice acting is incredible, especially with Dave Fannoy voicing Lee. The soundtrack is the second best soundtrack ive ever heard in my 16 years of gaming. The story is definitely in my top 10, it also has the best ending ive ever seen. The characters are relatable and their is huge character development in this game. This is truly a remarkable game, and will go down in history as one of the most ambitious and best games of all time.","For a interactive movie like game the graphics and the story are amazing truly entertaining you really get attached to the characters. This game is the best way to spend 7-9 hours playing every episode if your sick in bed all day.","Can you really become close with characters in a game? The Walking Dead proves yes. The beautiful comic style art with the honesty of the characters you know and develop relationships with make this game superb. The relationship you develop with Clementine and others, as well as fighting your way through the apocalypse makes this game fantastic. Despite the story, the overall good RPG elements are questioned because the majority of the game is decisions. Although I think it is an almost perfect blend it is no doubt the introduction of a barrage of actually playable console RPGs. So play this game, it brings out things inside you one wouldn't think a game couldn't bring out.","Awesome game, Awesome story  Great gameplay\rOne of the best game i played since Heavy rain story wise and probably best zombie story game as compared to other zombie games","A great game with an intense and interactive story and pulls you in with its great fleshed out characters that helps add depth to each decision you have to make and will take you on an emotional roller-coaster throughout its five episode story.","never have I felt so attached to characters before, never have been on the verge of tears so many times in because of a game before, and never did I think a point and click adventure game could be one of the best games I have ever played. your choices are immediately realized in this game and can have long or short term effects. it has revolutionized the use of story telling in a game similar to games like heavy rain but not quite to this extent. telltale game's the walking dead is a masterpiece and could not be scored lower than a 10. the experience will ultimately be different for every one, but it will be a good one","I've played through this twice now, once on 360 and again on PS3 and all I can say is that it's a masterpiece.\rI'd only seen 2 season of WD before playing through this game the first time but I knew what I was getting into.\rBeing a gamer in my 30s and growing up with point and clicks on PC and Amiga 500 I've been waiting for a game like this (to work on console) for years.\rEverything from how it is presented and the controls is perfect, the way you are meaningfully forced into making game-changing decisions (at the time of its release) makes for some of the most emotionally charged gaming experiences you could ever wish to put yourself through.\rI've recommended it to whoever I can who'll listen 10/10","Entretenido, atrapante y en general muy bueno pero el 8 es porque me falto jugabilidad... si me esfuerzo podr\u00eda contar las veces que toque el control de la PS3, no creo que hayan sido mas de 40 ni tampoco mas de 10 los enfrentamientos con zombies... Fiel al comic y a la serie en todo caso, TWD no se trata de matar zombies, sino de evitarlos. Aun as\u00ed me falto jugabilidad, la historia: 10 de 10 !!","This game is awesome, one of the best games iv'e ever played, the story starts as you being Lee Everet being sent to jail for murder when all of a sudden the zombie appocolips comes out of noware and the world goes to hell, while trying to find refuge Lee stumbles along Cleminetin an  year old girl that was left on her when the cryces happened, so then Lee and Clem team up to survive the world. This game most powerful element is its choices that you make through out the story that changes peoples idea of you and u will b making your own story. The only problem i have with this game is there is alot of framerate.","One of the best games i have ever played\rIt has the best story i have ever seen and watch and play and heard\rThe Game really have a decision that you need to choose, every single decision you make will affect the story of the game, it has a hard-to-choose decision, for example there are both decision that you need to choose which one you are going to choose to save? the girl or the boy? if you choose the girl the girl will be alive and the boy will be dead and it will affect the story, the same thing will happened if you choose the boy.\ri give this game a score of 10.","While the game is awesome, I'm inclined to give it a low score due to it being unplayable at times. What I mean is that at times when you have to make choices and stuff the game lags really bad and so you can't press what you have to so you die at times. If it weren't for this known fact that telltale knows about and has yet to fix as of almost 2 years ago I would of given the game a 9. Other than that the game is honestly awesome. Your choices affect so much through the game, and not just immediately but it has long term affects as well. Hopefully one day telltale fixes this lag issue.","The best way to describe the Walking Dead Season One is as an elaborate choose your own adventure story. There is some action, though it's relatively simple to make it through. The power of the game lies in its narrative and the characters you spend your journey with. The story is powerful and gripping, with decent replay value for a story driven, fairly linear game with limited action.\r The presentation for the game is decent. The graphics are cell shaded and look hand drawn, a style I enjoy myself but know some people do not . The character models don't quite move right, leaving you from ever being sucked into the game, but the graphics are not the point. The sound effects and voice acting are top notch. The cast does a great job from beginning to end with even the peripheral characters you run into doing an excellent job.\r The gameplay is simplistic, but you get what you expect. The game centers around the choices you make and how they affect your character, Lee, and the group he is with. There isn't a lot of combat, and the game feel cumbersome when you move away from areas that aren't focused on conversation and choices. If you're looking for a game with solid gameplay you're probably better off just moving on.\r As mentioned before the game's story is where it shines. To go into details would give spoilers, but the story is riveting and revolves around the choices you make. The characters are diverse and interesting. They make you want to care about what happens to them. For a story driven game there is decent replay value as I've made it through the game on three separate occasions without it feeling burdensome, but the game is short which helps it not feel drawn out.\r The one real gripe I have with the game, aside from the clunky feel to the game when in \"action\" oriented sequences, is how most of the choices don't really matter. The second time I went through the game I intentionally tried to make different choices to see what happened, and to be totally honest the game forced me down the same path I had taken the first time a lot, taking away the illusion that my choices mattered. What was going to happen was going to happen, and knowing that took away my feeling of agency in the game.\r The Walking Dead Season One is a solid, story driven game that will suck you in. If you've played the game before and feel the itch to play it again I would recommend renting the game due to its short length and relative ease. If you're looking to play it for the first time I would still recommend renting it, but if the only options are buy it or not play it it's worth buying at its lower than the average game price.","This is a game that is beautifully designed in the comic-book art style that TWD fans should truly enjoy and appreciate. I loved how Telltale used original as oppose to just copying the entire comic book series. Great game that I love playing over and over again.","Great game. Great story, great characters, good gameplay and, it might seem that the game hasn't any soundtrack, but it has and when she shows up, tears start falling of your eye...unwittingly. And the ending is great. There are \"AH!\" moments, \"OH!\" moments, and \"YEAH!\" moments. Freaking amazing. Super recommended. 9/10","I am speechless , i really don't understand how is it even possible for  me to care so much about some fictional characters . Great dialogues , awesome atmosphere , this game feels like an amazing journey . What makes this game what it really is today though is the fact that your in-game decisions will change the way the plot unfolds and even when you are very confident that you've made the right decision you still kind of doubt it deep in your heart . To sum up i recommend this game to anyone that is willing to pay close attention to the dialogue of this game and appreciate it for what it is , what i mean by that is that if killing waves of zombies with countless of weapons is what you are looking for , just don't go for this game","10/10 i loved it. I do not have to say anything more. But i need to write one hundred and fifty characters. i think my score can describe it..........","Ugh. For a game to live in the Walking Dead world, it's going to have to meet a pretty high bar. This fails. Totally. First, while the graphics are similar to what you would find in the comic/graphic novels, the motion -- or lack thereof -- is distracting. There's not much attention to detail as there really isn't much worth 'snooping around' in any given scene to find. You have about as much freedom of movement as in a choose-your-own-ending book and even less impact on the overall story, regardless what Telltale says about the story being 'driven by the choices you make' and 'your story could be very different from someone else's' since there just isn't that much variety in the decision trees and the seasons have the same ending. Point-click. Point-click. In the end, the story is the same, I'm just more or less of a dick based on the the decisions I made. That is, if my choices register and the game flows properly. TWD has had a number of bugs that prevented choices from registering correctly or loading the next scene. Cut scenes were known to be not smoothly flowing all the time causing some time 'rubber banding' effects. Most of these have been fixed. Next big problem is time to delivery. The first 'season' was billed as a new episode 'every month.' This didn't turn out to be the case as demonstrated by episodes being released an average of 42 days apart. For a story that is essentially predetermined (same outcome regardless of choice), waiting 42 days to play about 2 hours is frustrating. In season 2, Telltale seems to have dropped this commitment. I paid for the 'season pass' so while I did save some money, I don't think I got my money's worth and based on this experience I won't be buying any more Telltale games.","One of the best game I have ever played you take the role of lee\r and kick butt its has a really good ending choices makes people hate you and luv you\r Very good game indeed","People tend to disregard a game's story and replace it for its game play. If you're that type of person, it's time to get real. What Telltale Games does with a franchise that relies on its visuals and good story is that they emphasize on those key points. The overall attachment I had towards a game that I once was hesitant to buy had grown into what could be considered an obsession. Each chapter/episode this game provides is one more step towards a never-ending hell of emotion and graphic storytelling. Each episode provides the player with more insight on the situation at hand and more importantly, the people that are with you. You become one with the game. As tensions rise, you seem to be able to make harsh decisions seem like a common thing. As you become more in touch with Lee, the main protagonist, you feel nothing but sympathy for a man who we eventually find out killed a man who slept with his wife in spite of hatred. The story behind a grown man who was sentenced to jail who, after the outbreak of zombies, takes care of a little girl named Clementine is for sure to be never be taken lightly. No person is safe. No person can be trusted. Emotions will be flowing right through your body. Play this game as if you are in the game itself.","Oh man this game has officially made list of amazing games. let me tell you fellow reviewers this game is straight up the sadist game I have ever played and it is very heart felt I mean literally every choice you will make will make you feel miserable at times this game is filled with moments that make you cry but over all it is a an amazing game so go out and get on this emotional thrill ride today","I loved the show so I was eager to try this game out after so many people had praised it to death. I was certainly not let down at all. Similar to Mass Effect in many ways, where you choose your dialogue options, this game also makes you choose what characters to help and potentially save in the game. This makes you choose your favorite characters pretty early but the great thing about this game is you can replay it and see what happens with other characters.\r This game is a must play for anyone. If you don't like the show then that's no problem as the characters in this game are all original. The story is fantastic and it just gets better and better with every episode.","How could the developpers be so slopy as to forget to put a invert Y setting.  And the controls of the game are, for the most part terrible.  They only focused on a linear storyline, not about the game play.","One of THE BEST video games for story telling I have ever played.\r This was also the first game which I ever shed a tear whilst playing and wow, just amazing.","Descubr\u00ed The Walking Dead en PS3 y debo reconocer que qued\u00e9 con la boca abierta, es una serie que consta de 6 episodios donde nos introducimos en el mundo de \"The Walking Dead\" con un grupo diferente al de la serie televisiva pero si con un par de cameos m\u00e1s correspondientes al c\u00f3mic.\rEl juego es un point and click donde controlamos a Lee Everett, un hombre condenado a prisi\u00f3n que halla la libertad tras accidentarse durante los primeros brotes de la infecci\u00f3n zombie, conociendo en su camino a Clementine, una ni\u00f1a que ser\u00e1 su compa\u00f1era durante toda la serie.\rEl juego en si no innova en nada es una historia donde tendremos que tomar decisiones muy fuertes llegando a ser por momentos muy emocional, evocando tristeza, ira o frustraci\u00f3n dependiendo de c\u00f3mo interactuemos con Clementine y el resto de personajes.\rMi recomendaci\u00f3n es ju\u00e9guenlo, aprovechen que casi no hay plataforma para hacerlo, es una historia muy emotiva y atrapante.\r Lo bueno: La historia, el ambiente muy al estilo de los c\u00f3mics.\rLo malo: jugabilidad muy simplista.","I've played all the telltale games to date and this the best IMO, in fact this is the best point and click game I've ever played, I love this game so much I've completed in on PS3,ps4, vita and Xbox 360 lol, so this reviews ally's to all platforms although it obviously runs best on ps4 and dosent play quite as well on vita, not many duo's have stuck in my mind as much as lee and clem, but there not the only great charictors in this game there's loads, the story is fantastic music is nice and is just an alround great game, I could go on and on about how good this game is I really could, but you will never know how.

Conoce a una peque\u00f1a ni\u00f1a de nombre Clementine la cual los llevara de a vivir muchas situaciones , mas tragedias que buenas noticias, quiz\u00e1s la vida que le depara a un hombre y una ni\u00f1a en un mundo de zombies no sea de lo mas prometedor.\rEs un juego el cual no lucen las grandes gr\u00e1ficas ni la gran potencia tecnol\u00f3gica de otros juegos, pero  comparando con otros transmite mayor emoci\u00f3n,  pues que las voces que le dan vida a los personajes que iremos conociendo son excelentes , pero algo que me resulto incre\u00edble es que apesar de que no tiene los grandes gr\u00e1ficos vaya que esas expresiones que tienen los individuos en el juego resaltan mucho mas que otros trabajos que se jactan de la tecnolog\u00eda de motioncapture de los que he podido jugar previamente, y complementen maravillosamente las voces, tomamos decisiones en el juego las cuales repercutir\u00e1n en el  numero de integrantes con los que llegamos al final, pero al jugarlo mas de una vez y decir que pasar\u00eda si hago esto?, voy por aqu\u00ed?, no se diferente al anterior, no afecta de gran manera la historia pero apesar de ellos es una historia que no reinventa la rueda una historia sencilla bien contada, detalles que marcan y recordaras,\rPor lo anterior recomiendo ampliamente este juego.","wow\rthis game show that gaming also can make and impact on people\rgreat art style, great story, great character and many more\rall of us should try it at least once.","The story, the characters, the dialogues, felt so real. This game give you hard choices that'll effect the characters in the story and make you feel guilty about it. It show something we never experience before or awhile. It's a emotional rollercoaster and just thinking about it broke my heart because the characters feel so real it's like we lost a love one in the family. This game put Telltale Games in the spotlight and still is the best video game ever made.","This is less of a game and more of an interactive story. Put that aside, one of the most heart wrenching stories I've ever experienced.  I cried, I'll never forget it.","Finally! I finally got around to beating Tale Tales The Walking Dead, and I have to say damn, damn, damn. This game is awesome I know I won't be saying anything that you haven't already heard before but this game proves that story can beat gameplay any day of the week. I am in that camp I would rather play a game with an amazing story with meh controls, than a game with great gameplay but lame ass story. This game doesn't always have the best control scheme but it works to get you  to the  next bit of story. Sadly when you find out the game doesn't actually give you a choice on what happens it loses some of it's luster. A wise man said that this game gives you the elusion of choice and I completely agree with that. Folks in this game if someone is meant to die they are going to die one way or another. I personally think that is a pretty **** thing but it doesn't affect the story at all. This game was able to almost make me cry with the relationship between the character, it can be a real downer. This is the best zombie game out there and I believe it really captures one of the zombie apocalypse scenarios that we would love to see. It is an adventure game so people who only want fast gameplay and the hell with story avoid this game at all cost cause you will more than likely hate it. To the rest of you who are in my shoes and didn't jump on this game last year I got it for eight dollar and it was well worth the price. I give this 4.5-out of 5 the only reason this isn't a perfect game to me is because it didn't  have the best gameplay mechanics.","Probably the best episodic game ever created!

I never thought I'd be so compelled by an \"actionless\" game but TWD was a game-changer.\r It's also worth noting it is even better than the TV series and probably one of the best zombie-related works of all time. Its cartoonish graphics also allow it to age pretty well but overall doesn't fit the best in the game's desperate reality and that's my only complaint. Truly a gem in the overworked and saturated zombie games market.","this game is the best telltale game by far and you will remember this game for years to come.","Top Game. Emotional Game. Perfect. Story. For me up there with RDR2 as GOAT contender."]},"selected":{"id":"1058"},"selection_policy":{"id":"1057"}},"id":"1002","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1055","type":"BasicTickFormatter"},{"attributes":{"overlay":{"id":"1027"}},"id":"1023","type":"BoxZoomTool"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1056","type":"AllLabels"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1022","type":"WheelZoomTool"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1024","type":"SaveTool"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1025","type":"ResetTool"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1021","type":"PanTool"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1018","type":"BasicTicker"},{"attributes":{"text":"The Walking Dead Reviews"},"id":"1043","type":"Title"},{"attributes":{"bottom_units":"screen","fill_alpha":0.5,"fill_color":"lightgrey","left_units":"screen","level":"overlay","line_alpha":1.0,"line_color":"black","line_dash":[4,4],"line_width":2,"right_units":"screen","syncable":false,"top_units":"screen"},"id":"1027","type":"BoxAnnotation"},{"attributes":{"axis":{"id":"1017"},"dimension":1,"ticker":null},"id":"1020","type":"Grid"},{"attributes":{"color_mapper":{"id":"1003"},"major_label_policy":{"id":"1050"},"width":8},"id":"1044","type":"ColorBar"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1050","type":"NoOverlap"},{"attributes":{"source":{"id":"1002"}},"id":"1040","type":"CDSView"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1026","type":"HelpTool"},{"attributes":{"axis_label":"Sentiment Score","formatter":{"id":"1052"},"major_label_policy":{"id":"1053"},"ticker":{"id":"1018"}},"id":"1017","type":"LinearAxis"},{"attributes":{"active_multi":null,"active_scroll":{"id":"1041"},"tools":[{"id":"1021"},{"id":"1022"},{"id":"1023"},{"id":"1024"},{"id":"1025"},{"id":"1026"},{"id":"1045"}]},"id":"1028","type":"Toolbar"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1057","type":"UnionRenderers"},{"attributes":{"data_source":{"id":"1002"},"glyph":{"id":"1037"},"hover_glyph":null,"muted_glyph":null,"nonselection_glyph":{"id":"1038"},"view":{"id":"1040"}},"id":"1039","type":"GlyphRenderer"},{"attributes":{"fill_alpha":{"value":0.1},"fill_color":{"field":"Sentiment Score","transform":{"id":"1003"}},"line_alpha":{"value":0.1},"line_color":{"field":"Sentiment Score","transform":{"id":"1003"}},"size":{"value":10},"x":{"field":"rating","transform":{"id":"1035"}},"y":{"field":"Sentiment Score"}},"id":"1038","type":"Circle"}],"root_ids":["1004"]},"title":"Bokeh Application","version":"2.3.3"}}
